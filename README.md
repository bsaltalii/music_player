# 🎵 Music Player App

*Music Player App* is a responsive web-based audio player built with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to play, pause, and navigate through local or streamed music files with a clean and interactive UI.

## 🎯 Purpose

It demonstrates dynamic DOM manipulation, media control handling, and smooth user interactions using vanilla JavaScript.
